# APC Control

This repo contains code to control an ancient APC power strip via telnet of all things.  It starts with an old perl script I cobbled together years ago, and will potentially be ported to other languages.

### Perl Port
If you're on Ubuntu you can get the perl script working by installing the following packages:

    apt install libnet-telnet-perl

### Python Port
This project uses Python3 and requires a couple of non-standard modules:

    apt install python3-docopt
